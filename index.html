                Pokémon Crystal added a lot of new features to the already great Silver and Gold versions. However one feature that didn't change so nicely was resetting the in-game clock.
                What was normally an easy to accomplish thing now required players to due some pretty obscure mathematics to obtain a 'Password'.
                To do this, players would have to cross reference a chart to convert the characters into numbers, calculate remainders of Trainer IDs and wallet amounts from some foreign value,
                and do some benign addition and subtraction to obtain the final result. These calculations wouldn't work with scientific calculators so you would have to due all the division by hand.
                This tool aims at simplifying this whole process, it just requires the player's name, trainer id, and wallet amount to due all the boring calculations for you.
